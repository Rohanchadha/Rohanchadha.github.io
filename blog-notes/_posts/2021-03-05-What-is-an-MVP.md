MVPs are not about building something permanent.

An MVP is not your Product 1.0. Your 1.0 is the first Software product that you'll build if you decide your idea is investable. MVP's are vehicles to learn new things that you don't already know and sometimes may also be used to validate your assumptions.

Let's talk about 4 different types of MVPs.

> 1. Concierge MVP
> 2. The Wizard of Oz
> 3. The Landing Page
> 4. Email MVP

Concierge MVPs are customer focussed. You find out how customers are interacting with your product, what feautures do they care about!
