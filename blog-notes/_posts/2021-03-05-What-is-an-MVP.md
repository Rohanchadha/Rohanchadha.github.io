MVPs are not about building something permanent.

An MVP is not your Product 1.0. Your 1.0 is the first Software product that you'll build if you decide your idea is investable. MVP's are vehicles to learn new things that you don't already know and sometimes may also be used to validate your assumptions.

Let's talk about 2 very common types of MVPs.

> 1. Concierge MVP
> 2. The Wizard of Oz

**Concierge MVPs** are customer focussed. You find out how customers are interacting with your product, what feautures do they care about! All these features that your product has to offer will have to be carried out individually for each of your client, just like a concierge in a hotel (think Azkaban from Suite Life of Zack and Cody). 

To an end user, **Wizard of Oz MVP** looks like a finished product but in reality all the operations are not fully automated yet & are carried out by real humans. It's a very good way to find out whether your product is desirable or not by faking a User experience.
